# DOPE
This is a card-matching game based on the multiplayer table-top game called "Bold". I designed my own cards for this game front and back and implemented additional game mechanics. 
This can be played with 1-4 local players.  
This project was a class project done in high school and is solely for educational purposes only.

I used Java in IntelliJ and SceneBuilder together for this program.
