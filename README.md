# DOPE
WELCOME TO DOPE! 

This is based on the card game "Bold" with my own designed cards and additional game mechanics.
This can be played with 1-4 local players.  

Every card would have a color, a pattern, and an icon.
A matching pair of cards would match with at least one of these attributes. Cards with 2 matching attributes will give a higher score.

For example:
- a blue card with a dog icon and stripes pattern == MATCHES WITH == a blue card with a cat icon and hearts pattern and  --> 1 point!
- a blue card with a dog icon and stripes pattern == MATCHES WITH == a blue card with a dog icon and hearts pattern --> 2 points!
            
The goal of the game is to flip a card one at a time and find a matching pair of cards. The more cards you match, the more points you get!

Each player starts with 1 minute and 30 seconds to find cards during their turn. This player's timer starts to count down only during the player's turn, 
it doesn't reset back to 1 minute and 30 seconds. If the player finds matching cards, a few more seconds will be added to this timer.
The player has the option to end their turn early to save some time or to keep looking for matching cards. 
Keep in mind, that once a player flips two unmatching cards, their turn is over. If in any case, the player's timer hits zero, 
there is a grace period of five seconds for the player to save themselves by finding a matching card or to use a power-up!

These power-ups are the following they can either:
- Shuffle the cards on the "table" in case one of the players knows where two matching cards could be
- instantly get two matching cards (instant points for you!)
- Add more seconds to the player's time limit

Keep in mind, that these power-ups can be used at ANY time during a player's turn BUT they each have a shared cooldown so use them wisely! (multiple power-ups cannot be used)
The game ends once either all the cards are used in the deck, or every player's time limit runs out! The player with the most points wins! 

Good luck and have fun :D ! 

This project was a class project done in high school and is solely for educational purposes only.
I used Java in IntelliJ and SceneBuilder together for this program.
